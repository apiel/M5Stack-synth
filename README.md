# Zic

Zic is an audio library to play music with ESP32. This lib as been tested on a M5stack core2 and provide as well a set of UI component for this device. However, the lib is usuable on any ESP32 device and might even be usuable on any plateform, as it is not tightly coupled to Arduino.

Right now, it is using a bluetooth speaker to play sound. There is an attempt to use the built-in speaker from the M5stack but the sound is still not very good (WIP).
